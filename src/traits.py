# Traits are used to have generic effects (e.g. "unconscious") be able to be applied from multiple sources, while not entirely annihilating the trait when one source removes the trait
# Format is:
# TRAIT_FOO_BAR = "foo-bar"
TRAIT_LOCKED = "locked"

TRAIT_SOURCE_UNIT_TESTING_1 = "unit-testing-1"
TRAIT_SOURCE_UNIT_TESTING_2 = "unit-testing-2"
